# Unit Testing

This directory and its child directories contain all unit tests of this repository's code. For generic info regarding testing, see the top level [test readme](../README.md).

## Unit Testing Goals

Unit tests should:

- Test the *smallest* possible unit of code in a *single* way.
- Test the *smallest* possible unit of code in *every* way.
- *All* code *must* have *100%* coverage:
    - This includes things like files that define constants.
- Ensure *no code outside* of the CUT (Code Under Test) is executed.
- Environment changes should *never break* tests:
    - For example, changing the value of a value in a constants file should only cause tests to fail when the new value is invalid.
- Functionality changes *shale _always_* break tests.
- Implementation changes should *not* break tests... ideally.

## Directory Structure

Each directory in this `README.md`'s directory has the name of a command that may be used when this repo is used to configure a POSIX environment. Tests of that functionality are stored in each directory. If the functionality has supporting code, constants, etc, then tests of that code will be in a directory with the same name as the one used in the source code.

## Test Naming

Bellow is the unit test file naming convention:

```
<cutFileName>_[optional/required][Option/Argument]_<optionOrArgumentName>_spec.sh
```

For example, `output_optionalOption_help_spec.sh` would contain unit tests of the `--help`/`-h` option for the `output()` function.

## Tag Naming Requirement(s)

- The part of the tag name after the `:` *must* be the same as the title in camel case with the first character in lower case.
- The part of the tag before the `:` should be the same as the tag of its parent with the `:` removed and the first character of the right hand potion of the tag capitalized.
- The top level tag *must* follow: `<userFacingFunctionName>:<nextLevelDown>`:
    - Example:
        - Top three level tags of a util function called `createHeaderFooter()` used by a user facing function called `output()` would be: `output:output`, `outputOutput:util`, & `outputOutputUtil:createHeaderFooter` respectively.

[*See an example here*.](#test-structure-example)

## Unit Test Structure Requirement(s)

- All levels (`It`, `Describe`, etc) *must* be named.
- All levels, other than the bottom one, *must* have `:` as the last character in the name:
    - This is done so the test output is easier to read.
- Each level of the test should reflect how the CUT is organized, thus:
    - The top level `Describe` (see: [shellspec basic structure for more info](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec#basic-structure)) must be named the same as the user facing function the test is most closely related to:
    - For example:
        - If the test of of a function utalized by the `output` function and resides within `./output/util/utilFunc', then:
            - The top level `Describe` should have the title `Output:`.
            - The next level would be named `Util:`.
            - The next would be named `UtilFunc:`.
- The bottom level (`It`) must *always* have a unique tag.
- Each piece of functionality that can be tested separately from any other functionality, even if only partially, *must* be placed in its own file:
    - Splitting tests up into different files allows `shellspec` to run them in parallel.
    - Additional tests needed to get full coverage should be placed in a different file.

**Note:** If an existing test file doesn't follow any of these rules, then the one who is modifying the file must update the entire file to follow all rules.

## Test Structure Example

A test of `output()`'s `--help` option would look like this:

```
Describe "Output:" output
	Describe "Optional option:" outputOutput:optionalOption
		Describe "Help:" outputOutputOptionalOption:help
			It "-h" outputOutputOptionalOptionsHelp:h
				Test here.
			End
			It "--help" outputOutputOptionalOptionsHelp:help
				Test here.
			End
		End
	End
End
```
