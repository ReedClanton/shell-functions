SHELL_NAME_DOC=$(
	cat <<"EOF"
#/ DESCRIPTION:
#/	Produces the name of shell that this code is running under to stdOut.
#/
#/ USAGE: shellName [SPECIAL_OPTION]
#/
#/ NOTE(S):
#/	- Different shells render special characters, like tab and new line,
#/		differently. Thus if this doc contains any special characters that have
#/		two backslashes, know that only one is intended.
#/	- Used by shell environment config file(s), thus the logging() function can't be used.
#/
#/ SPECIAL OPTION(S):
#/	-h, --help
#/		Print this help message. Function will return code of '0'. No processing will be done.
#/		(OPTIONAL)
#/
#/ RETURN CODE(S):
#/	- 0: Returned when:
#/		- Help message is requested and produced.
#/		- Shell name has been found.
#/	- 3: Returned when shell name can't be found for any reason.
#/	- 140: Returned when given option name is invalid.
#/
#/ EXAMPLE(S):
#/	shellName
#/	shellName --help
#/
#/ AUTHOR(S):
#/	- Reed Clanton
